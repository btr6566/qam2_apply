To configure Sourcetree's extended integration to work with Azure DevOps, enabling features such as Pull Requests directly from the desktop application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Sourcetree:**
   - Ensure you have Sourcetree installed. You can download it from [Sourcetree's official website](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).

2. **Set Up Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT):**
   - Log in to your Azure DevOps account.
   - Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner and select "Personal Access Tokens".
   - Click "New Token".
   - Give your token a name, set an expiration date, and select the necessary scopes, such as `Code (read and write)`, `Work items (read)`, and `Pull Requests (read and write)`.
   - Click "Create".
   - Copy the token and save it securely, as you'll need it in the next steps.

3. **Add Azure DevOps Account to Sourcetree:**
   - Open Sourcetree.
   - Go to `Tools` > `Options` > `Authentication` (or `Sourcetree` > `Preferences` > `Accounts` on macOS).
   - Click the `Add` button.
   - In the `Host` field, select `Azure DevOps`.
   - Enter your username (which is usually your email address associated with Azure DevOps).
   - Select `Personal Access Token` for the Authentication Type.
   - Paste the Personal Access Token you generated earlier.
   - Click `OK` to save the account.

4. **Clone or Add Existing Repositories:**
   - To clone a repository from Azure DevOps:
     - Click on the `Clone` button in Sourcetree.
     - Enter the repository URL from Azure DevOps.
     - Select the destination path on your local machine.
     - Click `Clone`.
   - To add an existing local repository associated with Azure DevOps:
     - Click on `Add` button in Sourcetree.
     - Select `Add Working Copy`.
     - Enter the path of your local repository.
     - Click `Add`.

5. **Enable Extended Integration Features:**
   - Once the repository is added to Sourcetree, ensure the remote repository settings are correctly configured.
   - Right-click on the repository in Sourcetree and select `Repository Settings`.
   - Verify that the `Remotes` section has the correct URL for your Azure DevOps repository.

6. **Using Pull Requests in Sourcetree:**
   - After configuring the repository, you should see options related to pull requests under the `Repository` or `Branch` menus.
   - For creating a pull request, go to `Repository` > `Create Pull Request`.
   - Fill in the necessary details, such as the source and destination branches, title, and description.
   - Submit the pull request directly from Sourcetree.

By following these steps, you should be able to integrate Sourcetree with Azure DevOps fully, enabling you to use extended features like creating and managing pull requests from the desktop application.
