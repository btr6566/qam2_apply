  title: Delphi Select
  version: '2.2.5.6'
  description: >
    Delphi Select is a restful web Application Programming Interface (API) that
    allows access to the Experian Consumer Bureau and associated products and
    services through directed consumer targeting. It sits behind the OKTA
    service which provides authentication by user, business unit  or reseller
    and allows access to the developer portal test environment, directly
    simulating the live production environment.

    A call to Delphi Select can be one of the following types:

    - <b>Creating a Consumer Application</b>
      Delphi Select is predominantly used to target an applicant (Single Application) or group of applicants (Joint Application) based on name, address and date of birth information. This information is passed to Delphi Select to allow it to perform an Experian Bureau Search. As part of the application process a number of different products can be requested to support multiple business flows; this is configurable using the input API. However, the availability of various products is subject to the system account settings. A client must have the required permissions to access each product.

    - <b>Reprocessing a Consumer Application</b>
      Any Reprocessed Applications will always retarget the Experian Credit Bureau and write an appropriate footprint (set by the client). Delphi Score processing will de-duplicate any Credit Search Footprints (CAPS), if they occur within a three-day period of each other. All Credit Search Footprints (CAPS) are recorded for audit purposes. A Reprocess should not be used for a stand-alone Affordability call.

    - <b>Performing a Second Phase Call</b>
      Allows for additional products to be requested as part of an application using only the Experian Unique Reference Number and the appropriate control input values. Predominantly used by businesses to gather additional product data at various stages of an application without having to re-enter the applicant(s) details. For example, the system owner may wish to perform an initial credit assessment and then want to Identity Authenticate those applicants that are credit accepts; Delphi Select provides this functionality, through a Consumer Application followed by a Second Phase call for Identity Authenticate via use of the Consumer Application Experian Unique Reference Number and the appropriate control input values.

    - <b>Performing a Quotation to Full</b>
      Delphi Select allows for input requests to be processed as quotations using a quotation search type on the input call. These quotation calls allow a lender to leave a soft footprint on the Experian Bureau. A Quote To Full call is required when the customer chooses to make an application or credit, based on the quotation / eligibility response. Converting the quotation application into a full application will place a hard footprint search type on the Experian Bureau.

    - <b>Retrieving a Previous Application</b>
      Allows for the retrieval of a previously submitted Consumer Application including the results of the individual products requested. This call type must contain the original Consumer Application Experian Application Reference as the unique identifier to allow Delphi Select to retrieve the relevant application.

    - <b>Receive Data</b>
      Once an input request has been received, Delphi Select will process the request for the required products and return an output API response that contains a Unique Experian Application Reference and the results of the search.

    - <b>Metrics</b>
      The API response will provide metrics on the transaction start time and end time. Please note that the values displayed are not representative of the values that will be returned in the live environment.

            The FEU Confidence Level will hold two values when the FEU income estimate has been

                  month's worth of data to base the categorisation upon.

            The FEU Confidence Level will hold two values when the FEU income estimate has been 
                   derived from two current accounts.
 
            
            For the Maximum Turnover Every Month, only values of S/U/F/G/I/J are returned. Also for 
                     the last month estimate, the account will always be marked as stable since there is only one 
                  month's worth of data to base the categorisation upon.

          Scorecard Identifier (opt-in). The Scorecard Generation, CAIS Level
          and Market Sector. These determine the appropriate Delphi score for
          the portfolio

            This field holds either the scorecard ID or a special value.

            Note, there is no concept of opt-in or opt-out for the Short Term Lending score. When this score is requested this field will hold the New to Lender Short Term Lending Score

          The scorecard ID comprises of five components:

            1. The generation number – this will always be set to 0 for a Generation 10 score
            2. The CAIS level – this is set to 1 for Full CAIS scores and 0 for Non CAIS scores
            3. The sector – possible values are:
              B – Banking and Finance
              R – Retail
              T – Telcos
              M – Mortgages
              S – Sub Prime
              P – Short Term Lending: New to Lender
              N – Non CAIS
            4. The CII type and whether it is included or excluded in the Delphi Score – possible values are:
              O – Including CII without BDS
              W – Excluding CII without BDS
              B – Including CII with BDS
              C – Excluding CII with BDS
